# SPAC - Special Purpose Acquisition Contract
ICO based structure to fund and participate in value creation of Blockchain adoption in real economy.

Based on investment funds structuring that allow public investors to invest in private equity transactions executed by merging with or acquiring a company with the proceeds of fund’s initial public offering. Modifications to crypto SPAC are proposed to account for cryptocurrency environment. 

Proposed structure incentivizes the following outcomes:
To fund adoption of blockchain in certain niche through acquisition of the existing market player
To grow value of the acquired assets via use of proceeds and capturing blockchain-related synergies adopted by acquired player
To execute value added strategy by professional and reputable Founding team
To align founding team rewards and token buyers’ interests



How SPAC works?

Foundation issues tokens to use ICO proceeds for merging with or acquiring a company
Each token includes one warrant which allows token holder to buy additional token in future at fixed price
Tokens are traded which provide investors with a flexible exit strategy
Tokens liquidity enhances foundation position when negotiating a business combination with a potential merger or acquisition target
At least 85% of the proceeds raised at ICO are held in the escrow to be used at a later date for the merger or acquisition
Foundation execution team must sign letter of intent for merger or acquisition within [6 - 12] months of the ICO to initiate funds release
Otherwise it will be forced to dissolve and return funds held in the escrow to token holders
If a letter of intent is signed within [6-12] months, funds will be allocated from escrow to execution team
Target of the acquisition must have fair market value that is equal to at least 80% of SPAC’s funds raised at the time of acquisition
Participation in SPAC grants Foundation the right to 
Purchase assets
Purchase stock of target not involving a merger with the company
Merger with a target
Executed business combination require full disclosure of the target business, including complete audited financials, and terms of the proposed business combination
 
[When a deal is proposed, token holders have three options:
Approve transaction by voting in favor of it, elect to sell tokens in the open market, or vote against the transaction and redeem their tokens for a pro-rata share of the trust account
The assets of the trust are only released if a business combination is approved by the voting token holders, or a business combination is not consummated within 12 months of ICO]
Founders:
Experienced team composed with private equity, mergers and acquisitions and/or operating experience.
No salaries, finder's fees or other cash compensation are paid to the management team prior to the business combination and the management team does not participate in a liquidating distribution if it fails to propose a successful business combination.
Management team of a SPAC receives 20% of SPAC tokens if ICO is conducted, exclusive of the value of the warrants.
Tokens are held in escrow for 2–3 years [and management normally agrees to purchase warrants or units from the company in a private placement immediately prior to the offering.]
[The proceeds from this sponsor investment 3% - 5% of the amount being raised in the public offering are placed in the trust and distributed to public stockholders in the event of liquidation.]
SPAC is prohibited from business combination with any entity which is affiliated with an insider.
 
Investors:
Token holders bet on management’s ability to succeed in adoption of blockchain in existing business (vs. typical ICO when founders usually need to develop technology and gain market dominant position to impact the industry) 
 
Advantages of SPAC:
Capital management: SPACs escrow the committed capital which starts the "IRR clock" from the ICO for the SPAC management team.
Management fees: investors in PE funds typically pay 2% annual management fees irrespective of the amount of capital actually invested by the PE fund. Over the life of the PE fund, this can amount to 14%. Management fees are also payable after the life of the fund if there are unexited holdings on the assets still invested. Additionally, 20% of the realized profits are paid as "management carry" to the PE fund to incentivize them to produce high returns.
In comparison, SPAC management teams are paid no cash compensation. The SPAC Founder(s) and the Sponsor capital is at risk until an initial business combination is closed. If a business combination is effected then the SPAC Management Team receives 18% of shares as compensation. These shares are locked up for 12 months after the first transaction to ensure that the SPAC Management Team is focused on long-term value creation. Half these shares can be sold before the 12-month lock-up deadline if the SPAC's share price rises by 25% over the IPO price.
Transparency of team/investments: PE funds can pursue transactions as per the discretion of the Investment Committee. The PE Funds investors cannot choose to ignore a capital call if they are not interested in a particular investment. The LP interests in a PE fund are not liquid, there is no ready market for them and they tend to be typically valued at a discount to par given the initial "J-curve" of the IRR curve. The composition of the PE team is subject to diligence by the LPs. While there are key man provisions relating to change of certain personnel, the PE fund is free to change investment personnel without consent of the LPs.
SPAC investors hold liquid securities. They can sell their shares if they are not interested in exposure to the acquired entity. The SPAC management team undergoes scrutiny as part of the IPO process with disclosures around their career history and any criminal or civil legal issues. They are also subject to information disclosure obligations as per applicable Exchange regulations.
Liquidity: SPAC ICO units are liquid and can be freely traded on different Exchanges.
Better economics for the management teams and sponsors.
Certainty of growth capital in place - except in the case where token holders do not approve an acquisition.
Built-in institutional investor base and an experienced management team.
SPACs provide incentives for the management team to searches for best target to acquire. 
SPAC’s liquidity attracts more investors as they are offered in the open market.
SPAC Execution team members will take seats on the board of directors and continue to add value to the firm as advisors.
 
Disadvantages
Other than the risks normally associated with IPOs, SPACs’ public shareholders' risks may include:
limited liquidity of their securities until the close of the initial business combination. After the SPAC has acquired an operating company, the liquidity of the equity shares is similar to other listed companies of similar size.
low visibility on future acquisition(s) at the time of the SPAC public offering.
dilution due to founder shares (18-20%)
potential for uncertainty associated with the SEC merger/acquisition proxy process
There is also potential for delay and expense attributable to the public shareholders' special rights and the costs of functioning as a registered public company.
